# Temperature Monitoring Agent Notifying Another Agent üå°Ô∏èüì¢

This repository contains a Temperature Monitoring Agent that monitors the temperature in a selected location and notifies another agent, Bob, remotely when the temperature changes. The project demonstrates remote agent communication and was developed using the [uAgents](https://github.com/fetchai/uAgents) framework.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To use the Temperature Monitoring Agent to notify Bob when the temperature changes, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
 pip install uagents requests
```

### Step 2: Configure the Agents

- **Configure the Temperature Monitoring Agent:**

    - **Define the temperature readings for the selected location.**
    - **Define your desired minimum and maximum temperature range.**
- **Configure the Bob Agent (not shown in this code snippet):**
  - **Ensure that Bob is running and accessible remotely.**

### Step 3: Run the Agents üèÉ

- **Run the Temperature Monitoring Agent:**

  ```shell
  python temperature_agent.py
  python agent-bob.py
  ```
-**Ensure that Bob is running and ready to receive notifications.**

### Step 4: Monitoring and Notification

- **The Temperature Monitoring Agent will periodically check the temperature in the selected location.**

- **If the temperature falls below or rises above your desired range, the agent will notify Bob remotely.**

- **Bob will receive the temperature change notification and can take appropriate actions.**

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Temperature Monitoring Agent to notify Bob when the temperature changes:

- **Run the Temperature Monitoring Agent as described above.**
- **Ensure that Bob's agent is running and ready to receive notifications.**
- **Enter the city name you want to monitor (e.g., "London").**
- **Enter your desired minimum temperature (e.g., 15¬∞C).**
- **Enter your desired maximum temperature (e.g., 25¬∞C).**
- **The agent will periodically check the temperature, and Bob will be notified remotely if the temperature falls below or rises above your desired range.**

Now you can monitor temperature changes and notify other agents remotely with ease!

Enjoy temperature monitoring and agent communication! üå°Ô∏èüì¢
